## ðŸ’» Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of `<ReactJs / Styled-Components / MaterialUI>`
* You have a `<Windows / Linux / Mac>` machine. 
## ðŸš€ Framework:
<p>
    <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ðŸ”— ReactJS</a>
</p>

## ðŸš€ Libraries used for the construction of the project:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Material UI</li>
    <li>Styled Components</li>
</ul>

## Scripts at Your Disposal

Within the project directory, you have the ability to execute:

Before utilizing this project, it's necessary to install dependent libraries by running `npm install`. In case of conflicts, it may be necessary to execute `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.

## ðŸš€ Installation Uppy

To install the uppy_mockup, follow the following steps:

Linux e macOS:
```
npm install or npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

Windows:
```
npm install or npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### `npm start`

This command initiates the application in development mode.\
Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it within your browser.

Any modifications will trigger a page refresh.\
Lint errors will be visible within the console.

### `npm test`

This command launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode.\
For additional information, refer to the section about [executing tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This command compiles the application for production into the `build` folder.\
It accurately bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for optimal performance.

The build is minified and filenames include hashes for cache management.\
Your application is now ready for deployment!

Refer to the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for additional information.

### `npm run eject`

**Caution: this is an irreversible operation. Once you `eject`, there's no turning back!**

If you find yourself dissatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will eliminate the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, providing you with full control. All commands except `eject` will continue to function, but they will point to the copied scripts allowing you to modify them. From this point forward, you're on your own.

You're not obligated to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
